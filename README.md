An interactive graphical simulation of a physics problem. A person views the sunset at two different times depending on whether she is lying down or standing up. Given that time difference, estimate the diameter of the earth.

Why the interaction? Well, just because ... it was fun, and I got to learn ReasonML.

To run: clone this repository, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
